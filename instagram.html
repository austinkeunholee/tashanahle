     <h4 id="overviewHeader">Instagram redesign — another one</h4> 
        <p id="overviewParagraph">Many of us use Instagram for a plethora of things. Whether it be to
            showcase your perfectly organized fruit bowl, or to be consumed with watching the newly introduced Reels… It has truly evolved beyond just a medium for sharing photos. 
            
            With Instagram’s new redesign, there is now so much more than just brand-new UI and major interface changes. It has become a game changer for users. As a frequenter myself, the new development has only captured my attention more. Instagram has given users the ability to shop, sell, discover, be inspired, showcase media, and keep up with the homies all in one spot.

     <!--Second Text--> 
     <div>
        <h4 id="overviewHeader">If It’s so fantastic, then why propose a redesign?</h4> 
           <p id="overviewParagraph">Nothing’s ever perfect! Using Instagram quite often makes you realize some things— Well, maybe it doesn’t. However, being one that notices even the smallest of details, I often had thoughts on certain changes I would have liked to see implemented. And as time went by, those thoughts morphed into ‘why aren’t these things implemented!’. 
            With that, here is my proposal. 
           </p>

    <!--Third Text--> 
    <div>
        <h4 id="overviewHeader">Research Phase</h4> 
           <p id="overviewParagraph">According to Rani Molla and Kurt Wagner’s article on social media use, the average individual spends 53 minutes per day on Instagram in 2018, with over 500 million daily active users. Needless to say — It is a lot. 
            After Identifying my own concerns with the application, it was time to reach out to the public and conduct evaluations. Essentially, to hear what their needs are and follow up with the appropriate design solutions.
            Different people want different things of course. With businesses, influencers, Gen Zers and casual users all frequenting the same app, everyone has their own concerns and desires. It was important to emphasize with what was being articulated to me, and with that, I chose to tackle design issues that affected every user.

    <!--Design Proposal-->
    <div>
        <h4 id="overviewHeader">Design Proposals</h4> 
        <p id="designProposal">
        Here is what resonated the most:<br><br>
            1. Allow users to Schedule Content in Advance. <br>
            2. Allow users the freedom to modify their media feed.<br>
            3. Use AI to recognize content and present users with appropriate hashtags.
         </p>  
    </div>

    <!--Schedule Concept-->
    <div>
       <h4 id="overviewHeader">Scheduling Content in Advance</h4> 
       <p id="overviewParagraph">Ever wanted to post something at a particular time without the stress of having to remember? Maybe an anniversary post, or perhaps a happy birthday photo! The ability to schedule content ahead of time is a feature that permits users to be more organized and prompter with their lives. This gives content creators and business owners an edge by providing them with the ability to put out media without having to worry about forgetting, or simply not having the time to do so. Consistently posting at similar times will ultimately target a particular audience and provide them with content that they will have more chance of seeing and interacting with. Right now, users can schedule posts in advance via Facebook, but not through the app itself which leads to things being very inconvenient. Some users may not use Facebook, therefore it is a lot more efficient to have this feature built in the Instagram app.

    <!--Creative Mode-->
    <div>
        <h4 id="overviewHeader">Creative Control Within Your Profile</h4> 
        <p id="overviewParagraph">A lot of users tend to adopt a certain aesthetic for their profiles, which gives each page a unique and personalized vibe. However, it can be rather annoying to have a post misplaced within a feed, and not being able to move it. To prevent that sort of blockage, I prototyped a concept called ‘creative mode’ which is a feature that would allow users to have creative control over their feed. Within this mode, a user can move posts around from place to place and change the grid layout from the standard three columns to two. The later grants profile viewers the ability to see images more in depth. This particularity is great for photos that have a lot of characteristics and detail and grants a more up-close feel.

    <!--AI & Hastag-->
    <div>
        <h4 id="overviewHeader">AI and The Power of Hashtags</h4> 
        <p id="overviewParagraph">The hashtag, the sovereign of symbols in social media, is an extremely powerful character that heavily influences content like no other. It plays a crucial role in expanding your audience. Posts on Instagram interact with hashtags, and with  that, content can be discovered. Using AI to recognize content and suggest suitable hashtags will ultimately boost viewing and increase the discoverability of a user’s media.

    <!--What I learned-->

    <div>
        <h4 id="overviewHeader">What I learned</h4> 
        <p id="overviewParagraph">When I started this project, I wanted to specifically target UI and how users interact with the new changes. However, while conducting the research phase, I thought it would be more interesting to dive deeper, and I discovered more problems that I was eager to try and solve. I also understand that from a business perspective, there are certain features that are heavily desirable but simply may not work. And after reflecting on my redesign, I noticed certain elements that may conflict with each other. For example, scheduling posts may serve as a great convenience to all users, yet within the same light, it decreases activity within the app from the posters. And Instagram, being a business, would want to increase activity time rather than reduce it. All in all, working on this project really allowed me to think from an outside perspective, reflect more on the needs of others and challenge my problem-solving capabilities.
